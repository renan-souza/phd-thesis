\chapter{Experimental Evaluation} \label{chap6}

In this chapter, we design and conduct the experiments to support
the validation of our approach, WfSteer, to address the problem 
and hence the validation of this thesis's hypothesis.
Our hypothesis encompasses WfSteer's instantiation both for workflow scripts and for WMS, and within each instantiation we further distinguished between allowing for tracking steering actions and keeping the execution overhead low. This chapter follows this separation. 
Section \ref{sec_exps_wfscripts} presents the validation of WfSteer for workflow scripts, showing a qualitative analysis on allowing for tracking steering actions and a quantitative evaluation on the execution overhead, using real-world use cases in the O\&G industry. Analogously, Section \ref{exps_wms} has the validation of WfSteer's instantiation into a WMS, following this same organization.
